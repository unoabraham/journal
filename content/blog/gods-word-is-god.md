At the outset let me state the obvious here, I’m not a Christian apologetic, and I certainly don’t traverse the halls of social media to fix what ails the world.

However, I did come across some false teaching <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidtensen/posts/10156073523790935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/padma.nela/posts/10155821153938495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and as I was thinking about how to counter this false teaching, the Holy Spirit sent me a video that does the job perfectly.

Please watch the video in its entirety.

Something the Holy Spirit has taught me, Jesus was God and also the Word of God, and he could have said anything and the devil would have left Him (Matthew 4:1-11). Instead God (Jesus) chose the Word of God to counter the devil.

Yes, the Word of God Is God.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:1.

and

> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Hebrews 13:8.

Go ahead, take any problem that is facing you right now and counter it with the Word of God for the next 30 days. Then you will know the Word of God is God.

And if you want to beat the devil and be victorious in your life, the only way to guarantee that is with the Word of God.

But do it the way the Word of God teaches us in Joshua 1:8, by meditating on the Word day and night.


People do not operate in the power of God, because they do not operate in the Word of God.
