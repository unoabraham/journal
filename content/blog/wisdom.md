This is what I like to call wisdom for living.

* Praise God always. Seriously, it's a good thing to keep praising God always, and your life will be very much better for it. Psalm 150:6, Hebrews 13:15.

* Mark 11:24 is a good way to live your life. Some of the biggest miracles in my life have taken place because of applying Mark 11:24, and not because of fasting, praying, etc. Somebody said it well, God is not moved by your pain, He is moved by your faith.

* Don't give pearls to pigs. Not everybody will appreciate the good things you have to share, or even be thankful for all the wisdom you want to dispense. A pig will not know what to do with pearls, be sensible and don't waste your pearls. Matthew 7:6.

* Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.

* Don't believe in second chances. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the sooner you realize it, the happier you will be. People don't change because human character doesn't change. Once a thief, always a thief. You cannot meet a person who lies to his boss or colleagues and then claims to never lie to his wife. Just cannot happen. If you lend to a person who never returns money or possessions, you have nobody but yourself to blame. There are over 7 billion people in this world, if somebody has let you down, then you are better off giving someone new a first chance than a repeat offender the 3rd chance. Live your life too like you will not get a second chance.Â Want to eat, drink, taste, or do something, then do it today.

* Some people like to eat bullshit, sad but true. Just let them be.
