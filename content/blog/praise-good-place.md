As I was thinking what should the first post I make on Abraham.Life be about, the matter was settled for me when I was thinking about the topic of praise, and the Lord spoke to me at the same time about how praise is a good place to be.

I’ve had numerous ups and downs over the years in my spiritual walk, even given that I was a born again believer and a child of God. I’m sure this is true for every single believer in the world, even the apostles we hold in high esteem. I have had many phases of extreme success and prosperity, and then again I have also had many a season of struggle where nothing was going my way. Yeah, quite the yo-yo life I have had as a believer. Of course, life is a journey and we must learn to enjoy the journey itself, but all the while keeping our eyes focused on the prize (Philippians 3:14). However, there are many things we can do on this journey itself that will help us to enjoy the very best that God has to offer. One of the primary ways to achieve this is by living a life of praise.

For me personally, the greatest discovery in my walk as a born-again believer was learning the importance of praise and worship. Praise is extremely important, in fact I would even say essential in the life of every believer. Unfortunately, most think of it as optional and only something reserved for the Sunday morning praise and worship service.

When I rededicated my life to the Lord Jesus Christ as a young adult, one of the very first blessings I received was the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. I was also taught the importance of speaking and praying in tongues on a daily basis. We were taught to pray for a minimum of one hour every day in the spirit so we could enjoy all the blessings that came with the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

I was young back then, still in college, and so I had a ton of free time on my hands. I was also very hungry for the Lord and decided I would spend more than an hour praying in tongues every day so I would grow spiritually and also build myself up on my most holy faith (Jude 1:20). I spent a good 6 months praying in tongues every day for a good 6 to 8 hours each day. I would have an early dinner at around 6:30 p.m. and then I would make my way to the terrace where I would begin praying in tongues from around 7 p.m. Usually, I would pray till between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., but would also go on till 3 a.m. fairly frequently.

It was some of the very best time that I had with the Lord. It was also one of the very best spiritual foundations I had with the Holy Spirit as my teacher. I would highly recommend everyone to spend at least an hour every day praying in tongues, and the more the better. It will lay the foundation of revelation knowledge, and also put you in a position to receive the RHEMA Word for your life.

Back then, I would receive a promise in the month of December, a RHEMA Word specific to the coming next year. I really don’t remember the promises I received the first 2 years as a young believer, however, I do remember very vividly the 3rd and final promise I received back then. I took it to simply mean that the 3rd (and last) promise that I had received was good enough for my life and even throughout eternity. At least that was my thinking, but whatever the reason I have not received a specific promise or RHEMA Word concerning the next year since then. Anyway, to get back on track, the promise I received wasn’t really a promise, it was more of an instruction. The RHEMA word I received was Psalm 150:6 “Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD”.

As you can see, not really a promise. However, I was very quick to always act on the Word of God, and so I spent all of next year doing just that and acting on the instruction of Psalm 150:6. I stopped praying, I especially stopped praying and asking for anything, and I completely gave up on traditions like having a prayer list, fasting, praying with a pattern like the Lord’s prayer, the prayer of Jabez, etc. I did just one thing all year long, praise God. I praised God as I woke up, I praised God when I went to bed, and I praised God pretty much all the time. Praise was the only form of prayer and communication that I had with the Lord that entire year.

Looking back now after so many years have passed, I can say with 100% conviction that was probably the best year of my life especially in terms of spiritual growth and learning from the Holy Spirit. My fellowship with the Lord went through the roof, I reached new levels of intimacy that I did not know even existed. The presence of the Lord surrounded me constantly, I’d even go so far as to say 24 x 7. It’s a completely different experience, like you are living your life in heaven and not on earth when you experience that kind of intimacy and deep fellowship with the Creator of the Universe.

Since then praise has always been an integral part of my prayer life. However, that does not mean it has always been smooth sailing or that life has been a bed of roses for me. A lesson that I and my wife have learned is that everybody has problems.

Very recently I was having a really hard time with multiple things going on in my life. For the most part, I simply did not have any control over the outcome. In other words, there was nothing that I could do. Of course, that doesn’t mean I did not try. I tried to do many things to fix things on my own. I sought guidance from the Holy Spirit. I waited on the Lord. When nothing happened, I pulled out the big weapons of the Word of God, tongues, as well as meditating the Word.

However, nothing worked, at least not for long. Even if I did get breakthrough, I was immediately faced with another problem the very next day. It was a never-ending cycle, that plain sucked the life out of me. I finally reached the end of my rope, and simply gave up. I told the Lord I was done fighting, and instead, I would simply focus on praise and leave everything else.

When I quit fighting or even trying, I immediately sensed in my spirit that breakthrough had come. I just knew the worst was over, and everything would continue to only get better from that time. I began to see turnaround immediately, and one big issue was even solved the very next day. Things continued to improve and even fix themselves without me having to do anything. All I did was praise God.

The big lesson to be learned here is that resting in the Lord requires even more faith. God takes over when you quit, but He cannot step in unless you let go of the wheel. I have been in the same situation many times in my life. However, it’s not a lesson I have learned well enough it seems. Letting go and letting the Lord deal with it doesn’t come easily to me.

However, every single time I have tried to fix things on my own, and they only seemed to get worse, I had to reach the end of my rope and let God take over. Looking back, in every instance victory came almost immediately, just as soon as I let go and started to only focus on God and especially praising Him.

In every instance letting go and letting God has meant not just reaching the end of my rope, but realizing that I would be okay living with the problem and instead choosing to focus on praising God. In other words, I would cease all manner of action and only focus on the singular action of praising God. That sounds very counterintuitive, but let me assure you breakthrough and victory have come very quickly when going this route. But I will admit, I really don’t seem to have learned this lesson very well, or maybe letting go and giving up total control comes very hard to us as human beings.

The bigger lesson learned through this recent ordeal and the ensuing victory was the importance of staying rooted in praise. I had to come to the place where all I could do was praise God and nothing else. Like I said, it sounds counterintuitive, but it works every single time. Anyways, the really big lesson that I learned was when God spoke to me “Praise is a good place to be”. Let that sink in, praise is a good place to be in. You don’t really need to do anything unless the Lord gives you specific instructions.

Too often we are very much like monkeys. We just need to do something, use every trick in the book, and use all of our skills and knowledge to fix every situation in our lives. And let us be honest here, it takes even greater faith to not do anything and trust in the road 100%. Imagine that, not doing anything at all even though everything around you is falling apart. That would require great faith indeed, especially when you see everything around you breaking down, and you still choose to do nothing about it but instead spend time praising God.

However, the Lord looks at things differently. I caught a glimpse of His perspective when He spoke to me the words “Praise is a good place to be”. The world’s wisdom will tell you that you always need to do something about everything. Only God will tell you to rest in Him (Matthew 11:28-30) or to be still and know that He is God (Psalm 46:10).

I discovered these spiritual truths many years ago, and I try my very best to live by them. However, one also does tend to forget them from time to time, especially when one is flustered and/or in a fix. But I always do find my way back to this truth, and thankfully, for the most part, sooner than later. Then I relearn the lesson of praise and resting in Him.

Looking back I will tell you that every major blessing in my life has been the result of abiding and resting in His presence, receiving the RHEMA Word, and then simply acting on it.

I have an extremely good life. I have freedom of time, financial freedom to do what I want and when I want. I enjoy good health. I have a wonderful and loving spouse. I am constantly surrounded by people who love me and support me in everything. However, all of this pales in comparison to knowing God intimately (John 17:3) and being able to fellowship with Him 24 x 7. That must be your only goal.

Knowing God intimately is the call on your life.
