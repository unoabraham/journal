Hey, I'm Rajiv Abraham.

I'm a Christian and a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ from India.

Most of the world is hurting and struggling with pain, as was I. And very much like the world, I tried a number of things to overcome the pain until I came to the realization that I cannot ever be free of the pain and suffering, at least not in my own strength.

That led me to the discovery of the Lord Jesus Christ, a discovery that changed me and transformed my life. You see, unlike the world which can only give you things that will occupy your mind and space for a little while, receiving the Lord Jesus Christ into your life will fill a void that nothing ever will.

You have a God shaped void in your heart that only God can fill.

Now I have the Lord Jesus Christ living on the inside of me, and this has transformed and impacted my life from the inside out. The result is a life of victory and abundance, as promised in John 10:10, and freedom from sickness and lack of any kind, a.k.a. Zoe: The God-Kind of Life.

Over the years I have experienced many miracles, healings, and countless blessings, and this is my attempt at journaling them, and journaling my personal walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.
